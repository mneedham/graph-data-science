= Particle Filtering

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Particle Filtering algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Particle filtering measures the proximity between source nodes and other nodes in the graph.
It is an alternative to the <<algorithms-page-rank-examples-personalised, Personalized Page Rank>> algorithm that runs directly against Neo4j rather than a projected graph.

[[algorithms-particle-filtering-context]]
== History and explanation

Particle Filtering was proposed by Denis Gallo, Matteo Lissandrini, and Yannis Velegrakis in their 2020 paper https://people.cs.aau.dk/~matteo/pdf/EDBT20-particle-filtering.pdf[Personalized Page Rank on Knowledge Graphs: Particle Filtering is all you need!^].

[[algorithms-particle-filtering-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Particle Filtering algorithm

* Particle filtering has been used to build the movie recommendation engine used by https://mindreader.tech/[MindReader^], a novel dataset providing explicit user ratings over a knowledge graph within the movie domain.

[[algorithms-particle-filtering-examples]]
== Examples

In this section we will show examples of executing the Particle Filtering algorithm on a concrete graph.
The intention is to illustrate what the results look like and to provide a guide in how to make use of the algorithm in a real setting.
The example graph looks like this:

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
